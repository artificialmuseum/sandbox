This is the artifact creation sandbox for the [Artificial Museum](https://artificialmuseum.com).

Creators can use this Sandbox to customize various features in our app:

* Custom Artifact (edit src/artifact.js to edit).
* Custom Skybox (change src/skybox/skybox.jpg to overwrite the default. max size is 4096x2048).
* Custom Render frame logic (change the render() function in js/index.js)
* ...

## getting started

npm start

# alternative, on systems with python installed:
python -m http.server

# the sandbox is running at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000), point your browser there to see it.
